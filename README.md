FURNITURE APP 
The Furniture App is a mobile-based e-commerce application developed as part of my 6th semester academic project. It simulates a real-world online furniture shopping experience by allowing users to browse products, navigate through categories, manage a shopping cart, and authenticate through login/signup functionality.

This project reflects my growing expertise in mobile app development, especially in building user-centric, responsive, and functional applications using modern development tools and design practices.

üéØ Project Objectives
Design and develop a clean and user-friendly mobile application.

Implement multiple screen navigation and dynamic UI rendering.

Apply user authentication (sign-up/login) to create personalized experiences.

Simulate e-commerce functionality like product browsing, categorization, and cart management.

Strengthen practical knowledge in mobile development frameworks and state management.

üîç App Features
üè† Homepage with Category Navigation
Upon launching the app, users land on a visually appealing homepage that presents different furniture categories in an organized panel layout. This screen acts as the gateway to explore all the furniture items.

Categories include:
Living Room: Sofas, coffee tables, TV units, etc.

Bedroom: Beds, wardrobes, side tables, etc.

Kitchen: Cabinets, dining tables, kitchen storage, etc.

Outdoor: Patio chairs, garden benches, etc.

Study Room: Study tables, bookshelves, office chairs, etc.

Each panel acts as a clickable section that navigates to a dedicated screen showing the products under that category.

üîê User Authentication
User authentication provides access control and personalization:

Sign Up Page:
New users can create an account by providing details like email and password. Form validation ensures proper inputs before submission.

Login Page:
Registered users can log in to continue shopping. If credentials are incorrect, error feedback is displayed.

These features simulate the core user management system of a real e-commerce app.
