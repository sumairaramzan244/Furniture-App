The Furniture App is a mobile-based e-commerce application developed as part of my 6th semester academic project. It simulates a real-world online furniture shopping experience by allowing users to browse products, navigate through categories, manage a shopping cart, and authenticate through login/signup functionality.

This project reflects my growing expertise in mobile app development, especially in building user-centric, responsive, and functional applications using modern development tools and design practices.

üéØ** Project Objectives**
Design and develop a clean and user-friendly mobile application.

Implement multiple screen navigation and dynamic UI rendering.

Apply user authentication (sign-up/login) to create personalized experiences.

Simulate e-commerce functionality like product browsing, categorization, and cart management.

Strengthen practical knowledge in mobile development frameworks and state management.

üîç **App Features**
üè† Homepage with Category Navigation
Upon launching the app, users land on a visually appealing homepage that presents different furniture categories in an organized panel layout. This screen acts as the gateway to explore all the furniture items.

**Categories include:**
**Living Room**: Sofas, coffee tables, TV units, etc.

**Bedroom:** Beds, wardrobes, side tables, etc.

**Kitchen:** Cabinets, dining tables, kitchen storage, etc.

**Outdoor**: Patio chairs, garden benches, etc.

**Study Room**: Study tables, bookshelves, office chairs, etc.

Each panel acts as a clickable section that navigates to a dedicated screen showing the products under that category.
